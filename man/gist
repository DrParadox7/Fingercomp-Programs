NAME
  gist - download and upload files from/to Gist

SYNOPSIS
  gist [-p] [--P=mode] [--d=desc] [-sRqQlriG] [--f=filename] <id> [file]

DESCRIPTION
  This program makes it easy to download and upload files to/from Gist.
  
  This program requires an internet card with HTTP enabled in the OpenComputers configuration.

OPTIONS
  When uploading, provide a list of files as arguments: <path to local file>=<gist filename with .extension>
  
  -p
    Upload files to gist

  --P=mode or --public=mode
    [upload] 's' makes gist secret, 'p' makes it public (latter is the default).
  
  --d=description or --description=description
    [upload] Set the description of a gist.
  
  -s
    If uploading, shorten the resulting URL. Otherwise shorten a Github URL given as the first argument.
  
  -R
    Show raw URL to a file.
  
  -q
    Quiet mode.
  
  -Q
    Superquiet mode: do not show errors.
  
  -l
    List files in gist and quit.
  
  -r
    Override the output file even if it exists.
  
  -i
    Show file information.
  
  -G
    Show gist information.
  
  --f=filename or --file=filename
    Specify a gist file to work with.
  
  -t
    Prompt for a GitHub OAuth personal access token (needs to have gist scope to work). Requires OpenComputers 1.6 and higher.
  
  --t=token or --token=token
    Use a specific token. Not recommended, since the token will be visible as plain text. Requires OpenComputers 1.6 and higher.

  --u=gistid
    [upload] Instead of posting a new gist, update an existing one with a specific ID. Provide files to modify as if you were uploading them to Gist. Requires a correct token, see -t. Also requires OpenComputers 1.6 and higher.

GITHUB OAUTH TOKENS
  These tokens can be used to increase API limits to 5000 queries and to work with user account. For example, if token is provided when uploading, the resulting gist will be posted under the user account.
  You can get these tokens here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  When you do so, do not forget to set the gist scope, otherwise the token will not have any effect for the program other than increasing rate limits.

EXAMPLES
  gist -s -p --P=s --d="Hello, world!" /examples/test.lua=test.lua
    Uploads file /example/test.lua as a secret gist with description "Hello, world", and shows the short URL.
  
  gist -G https://git.io/example
    Gets the gist information.
  
  gist 1a3b5b7c9d1e3f5a7b9c
    Prints gist's file contents.
  
  gist --f=helloworld.c -r https://git.io/example helloworlds/hello.c
    Saves the contents of the file helloworld.c in the gist in helloworlds/hello.c, overrides the file if it exists.
  
  gist -t --u=12345678901234567890 -p --d="New description" /new/file=file.lua
    Changes the description of the gist with the ID 12345678901234567980 to "New description", and updates contents of the file file.lua. Prompts for the GitHub OAuth personal access token.
  
  gist -s -p --d="Hello, world!" --P=s -t /hello/hello.cpp=hello.cpp
    Prompts for the GitHub OAuth personal access token, and then uploads the file hello.cpp to Gist. Returns the short URL to the gist.
