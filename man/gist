  --P=mode or --public=mode
    [upload] 's' mode makes gist to be secret, 'p' - public.
  
  --d=description or --description=description
    [upload] Set a description for a gist.
  
  -s
    If uploading, shorten the resulting URL. Else shorten the Github URL given as the first argument.

    Superquiet mode: do not show errors.
  
  -l
    List files in gist and quit.

    Override the file even if it exists.
  
  -i
    Show the file information.
  
  -G
    Show the gist information.
  
  --f=filename or --file=filename
    Specify the gist file to work with.
  
  -t
    Prompt for a GitHub OAuth personal access token (needs to have gist scope to work). Requires OpenComputers 1.6 and higher.
  
  --t=token or --token=token
    Use the given token. Not recommended, since the token will be visible as a plain text. Requires OpenComputers 1.6 and higher.

  --u=gistid
    [upload] Instead of posing a new gist, update the existing one with the given ID. Provide the files to modify as if you were uploading them to Gist. Requires the correct token, see -t. Also requires OpenComputers 1.6 and higher.

GITHUB OAUTH TOKENS
  These tokens can be used to increase API limits to 5000 and to work with user's account. For example, if the token is provided when uploading, the gist will be in the user's account.
  You can get these tokens here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  When you do so, do not forget to set the gist scope, otherwise the token will not have any effect for the program except increasing rate limits.

EXAMPLES
  gist -s -p --P=s --d="Hello, world!" /examples/test.lua=test.lua
    Uploads file /example/test.lua to a secret gist with description "Hello, world" and shows the short URL.
  
  gist -G https://git.io/example

  gist --f=helloworld.c -r https://git.io/example helloworlds/hello.c
