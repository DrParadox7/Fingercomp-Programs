Makes it incredibly easy to monitor your RailCraft tanks.

* Hooks up tanks attached to computer while the program is running, and handles disconnecting of tanks.
* Looks pretty.
* Has a configuration file.
* Can monitor multiple tanks at the same time.

### Usage
Place an adapter right next to a RailCraft tank and install a tank controller upgrade into the adapter. Edit configuration file (`/etc/railtank.cfg`) if needed, and run the program.

That's it, pretty much.
