# libsemver
*A parser of Semantic Version strings ported to MoonScript*

Original version was written in Python and is available [here](https://git.io/vKTbW).

Since it's a port, you can use the documentation [here](https://python-semanticversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). I didn't modify the way it functions.

The `libsemver` package only contains transpiled Lua code. The sources are in the `libsemver-src` package.
